# AzzyAI

This is the source code repository for AzzyAI. 

I no longer play RO, and do not have time to take it up or maintain this AI except on a paid basis ($50/hr - that's what I get for other paid projects). I would like to find someone else to take up further development and maintenance of this AI - please contact me if you are interested - I can provide a bit of orientation for someone taking this on. 

=== Organization ===

* DEFAULT contains the default AI
* USER_AI contains AzzyAI
* scripts contains scripts used to prepare releases of AzzyAI
* AzzyAIConfig contains the source code for the config tool

### New Option
* LavaSlideMode now supports "Self" to cast at Dieter instead of the owner.
